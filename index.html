          <blockquote cite="http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/rdv10n2/brecht.htm">
            <p>Often he was honoured and profusely<br>
            The Comrade Lenin. Busts there are and statues<br>
            Cities were named after him and children.<br>
            Speeches are made in numerous languages<br>
            Rallies there are and demonstrations<br>
            From Shanghai to Chicago, in honour of Lenin.<br>
            But thus they honoured him<br>
            The carpet weavers of Kuyan-Bulak<br>
            A small village in southern Turkistan:<br>
            <p>Twenty carpet weavers stand there in the evening<br>
            Shivering with fever, in front of their humble loom.<br>
            Fever runs riot: the railway station<br>
            Teeming with buzzing mosquitoes – a thick cloud<br>
            Arising from the swamp behind the old camel cemetery.<br>
            But the train, which<br>
            Once in two weeks brings water and smoke, brings<br>
            Also the news one day<br>
            That the day for honouring Lenin lies ahead<br>
            And so decide the people of Kuyan-Bulak<br>
            Carpet weavers, poor folk<br>
            That for the Comrade Lenin also in their village<br>
            A gypsum bust would be installed.<br>
            But as the money is collected for the bust<br>
            All of them stand<br>
            Trembling with fever and contribute<br>
            Their hard earned kopecks with wobbling hands.<br>
            And the Red Army soldier Stepa Jamal, who<br>
            Carefully counts and meticulously watches,<br>
            Sees the readiness, to honour Lenin, and is filled with joy.<br>
            But he also sees the uncertain hands.<br>
            And all of a sudden he makes a proposal<br>
            To buy petroleum with the money collected for the bust<br>
            In order to pour it on the swamp behind the camel cemetery<br> 
            From where the mosquitoes come, which<br>
            Cause the fever<br>
            Thus to combat the fever in Kuyan-Bulak, and indeed<br>
            To honour the late, but<br>
            Not to be forgotten<br>
            Comrade Lenin.<br>
            <p>This was agreed to. On the day of paying respect to<br>
            Lenin they carried<br>
            Their battered buckets, filled with black petroleum<br>
            One behind the other<br>
            Over there and spread it on the swamp.<br>
            <p>So they benefited themselves, in paying homage to Lenin and<br>
            Paid homage to him, in that they benefited themselves and had<br>
            Therefore understood him well.<br>
            <p style="padding-left:75px;">2</p>
            <p>We have heard how the Kuyan-Bulak folk<br>
            Paid their respect to Lenin. As now in the evening<br>
            The petroleum had been bought and discharged over the swamp<br>
            Stood up a man in the assembly, and he demanded<br>
            That a commemoration stone be erected at the railway station<br>
            Reporting these events, containing<br>
            The altered plan and the exchange<br>
            Instead of Lenin’s bust the fever eradicating petroleum barrel,<br>
            And all this in honour of Lenin<br>
            And they did that too<br>
            And mounted the slab.<br>
            <p>(<b>Note:</b> Kuyan-Bulak is the railway station of Ferghana in Uzbekistan. The Slab had the text: ‘In this place there should have been a memorial to Lenin, but instead of the memorial, petroleum was brought and poured over the swamp. Thus Kuyan-Bulak, in memory of Lenin and in his Name smothered malaria’. <i>Translator</i>.)
